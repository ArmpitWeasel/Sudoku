# Sudoku
Testing out backtracking and pygame with a game of Sudoku
Pygame interface isn't set up how I'd like it. The timer and the crosses arent possitioned correctly and are cut off.
Once I get the pygame interface sorted out I want to get it set up with a randomizer so that the eachtime the program is launched there's a fresh puzzle to sort out other then having to redo the random example I found in my Grandma's Sudoku book.
As a final update before putting this little project to bed I'll make it run as a standalone .exe file so I can play it where ever and e proud of this beginner program of mine.
